// Complete the following recursive definition of a "member" function to check whether
//  an element "a" is a member of a list of integers "xs".
// Your implementation of "member" MUST be recursive and not use the builtin "contains" method from the List class.
// EXAMPLES:
// - member (5, List (4, 6, 8, 5)) == true
// - member (3, List (4, 6, 8, 5)) == false

def member (a : Int, xs : List[Int]) : Boolean = {
  // TODO: Provide definition here.
  false
}
