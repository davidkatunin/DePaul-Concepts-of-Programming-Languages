# Instructions #

This assignment shows you how to represent expressions as data structures.  This is something
that is done when you write an interpreter, compiler, or other tool that manipulates source code.

The tree data structures that represent expressions are created in Scala as algebraic data
types, i.e., using traits, case objects/classes.

Read adt.scala and then complete the exercises in this directory in the following suggested order:
 * make_exp1
 * make_exp2
 * use_pretty_printer
 * use_evaluator
 * count_exp_int
 
For each exercise, edit the Scala code in the file of the same name (with suffix ".sc").
That is, you should edit file "factorial.sc" as your first step.

See <../README.md> in the parent directory for further instructions.

# Grading #

 * You MUST NOT use while loops or (re)assignment to variables.
   You must use recursion instead.
   You can use "val" declarations, but not "var" declarations. 

 * You may declare auxiliary functions if you like.
