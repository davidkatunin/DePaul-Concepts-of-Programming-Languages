# Instructions #

Complete the exercises in this directory in the following suggested order:
 * constant5
 * constant
 * counter0
 * counter
 * get_and_set
 * get_and_set_spy
 
For each exercise, edit the Scala code in the file of the same name (with suffix ".sc").
That is, you should edit file "factorial.sc" as your first step.

See <../README.md> in the parent directory for further instructions.

# Grading #

 * You MAY use (re)assignment to variables and "val" and "var" declarations (you will have to).

 * In all of the exercises in this directory, you can only add code between the existing "{...}" for the val/def.  
   That is, you cannot add new val/def at the toplevel in one of the ".sc" files.
